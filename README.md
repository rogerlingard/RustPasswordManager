# Overview

Look inside the src file to see the Rust Code.

Why I chose this project was because I decided that I wanted to learn another programming language and better my learning skills. I think that it's very important as a programmer to know how to adapt to languages and know how they work fundamentally. Why I chose Rust was because I had done like a thirty-minute programming demonstration of Rust and I just remember it being a little weird and actually quite impressive. So, I decided to put some effort into learning it because that demonstration was about a year or two ago. 

I decided to do a password manager project was because I think it would be very cool to have my own password manager, and Rust would be a good way to keep information while learning a new language. I also think that if you really value your own online security then you would want to have a password manager that isn't owned by a company that could get hacked. Which is why I did this project, I wanted to be able to have a place that I could store my passwords and have it be secure from hacking attempts (I am less likely to be a target than a big company that stores passwords, probably).

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

- Encrypting either the file itself or the information within the File (I know that Rust can do that, and it would be a great way to protect data)
- Adding a way to edit and change the entries of your passwords, so that you can update passwords or usernames.
- A way to randomly generate a strong password.
- Making a GUI that would make it easier to see and use while trying to add passwords as it would make it a step above a commandline project.
